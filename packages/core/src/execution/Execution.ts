 * a result of each individual job execution. One option would be to return the
 * result of a job that completes first. Second option is to return result of
 * all jobs once they're all complete.
 *
 * For serial execution you should define an option that affects how arguments
 * passed to the `execute` method are distributed. They could be either
 * supplied to each job individually (thus meaning one job's mutation won't
 * affect another job) or they could be supplied to the first job and then
 * piped through other jobs.
