It's been a while since our last major release (v17), this december it will be more than 3 years. Throughout that time, we managed to release: 15 minor versions with new features and improvements along with multiple bug fix patch versions.

This helped us to iron out all the bugs and make sure that v17 is one of our most stable releases yet.
