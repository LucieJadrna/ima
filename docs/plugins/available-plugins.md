We've already described a way to [create your own IMA.js plugins](./plugin-interface.md#plugin-registration)
through a very simple interface. Now we would like to talk about [IMA.js-plugins](https://github.com/seznam/IMA.js-plugins) monorepo that already **contains variety of plugins** that covers many of the common use cases.

## IMA.js-plugins

Each plugin in [this repository](https://github.com/seznam/IMA.js-plugins) is thoroughly tested and maintained, so it always works with the most up to date IMA.js version. We, here at [Seznam.cz](https://www.seznam.cz/) use it daily in production on many of our projects, so don't worry about using them safely in the production environment.

Without further ado, let's quickly describe in this compact list **what each plugin does and when you would want to use them**:

This list is updated manually, so there can be situations where it doesn't match on 100% what is currently present in the monorepository itself.
